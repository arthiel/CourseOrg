        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>MySchedule, a system to organize your (Computer Science) future at RIT.
        The future includes a system where you can determine what you need to do
        to fulfill your requirements over your 4 or 5 years here.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="surrBox">
        <h3>How is this useful?</h3>
        <p>Do you ever go to the advising office, trying to figure out your courses?
        Or maybe you're planning out your schedule, and you don't want to get out or
        print a new worksheet that your adviser handed you months ago. Looking at this
        interactive worksheet will allow you to see what you have done, and what you
        have yet to do.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="surrBox">
        <h3>What do I do?</h3>
        <div id="toCourse">
            <p><a href="courses.html">Go Here</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>You'll be lead to the tradition Computer Science schedule,
        as given by the Computer Science department on their
        <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/programs/ugrad/curriculum">Website</a>.
        Just drag and drop all the requirements into their prospective slots, based
        on when you took or will take them. (Some requirements are not listed on that
        curriculum page, and were taken from the advising worksheet.)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="surrBox">
        <h3>Why only Computer Science?</h3>
        <p>Simply because I'm a CS major, and I felt the need of one of these. In
        the future, I'll make it accessible to other majors, but for now, this is
        what is best.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="surrBox">
        <h3>Current Features</h3>
        <p>Currently, I have the following things implemented. There is a ton more
        I want to do with this, but for now, this is what I have:
            <ul>
                <li>A usable interface</li>
                <li>The basic drag and drop feature</li>
                <li>Traditional CS curriculum put into place, matching both the
                CS Flow Chart, and the CS Worksheet.</li>
                <li>Allow for Calc A-C Track and CS For AP Track</li>
                <li>Allow extra options/years for grad students</li>
            </ul></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="surrBox">
        <h3>Any Future additions?</h3>
        <p>In the future, I plan to do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Allow you to select what year you are, organize the schedule you
                    have already taken, and have it fixed so you don't mess up your
                    future!</li>
                <li>Keep pre-requisites in mind, so you can't accidentally jump ahead
                    when you aren't actually allowed to.</li>
                <li>Make short little descriptions for each "course", explaining,
                    very generally, what each course is.</li>
                <li>Allow users to save, so they don't have to do it all over again</li>
                <li>Create a virtual worksheet.</li>
                <li>Create a better UI, make everything look prettier!</li>
                <li>Make the table have fixed widths.</li>
                <li>Allow for options of differnt tracks to follow, the Liberal
                Arts Minor track, the Liberal Arts Concentration
                track, the different Science tracks, etc.</li>
                <li>Allow users to add extra "unnamed" or "extra" courses if necessary.</li>
                <li>Making it hacker-proof... grr.</li>
                <li>Preparation for the semester system in the end.</li>
                <li>The ability to add more years if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            
            I may get to these features soon, or I may get to them a lot later. Some require
            a lot more time than others, and some require re-working this entire project.

        <h3>Information on the Project:</h3>
        <p>This project was written with the use of XHTML and Javascript (with JQuery).
        Originally, this project started over the summer (20084), when I was teaching
        myself Flash and Actionscript (that multi-colored creation can be found here).
        <br />
        <br />
        I learned a lot about Javascript and JQuery through this project, both of which
        I had never really learned before, and it was a great way to learn! If you want
        to include the first edition of this project, then I also learned Flash and
        Actionscript, which I also hadn't done much with before.
        <br />
        <br />
        The editor I used is called Komodo Edit, which was also an interface I just
        started to use. I would strongly suggest it to anyone who wants a lightweight
        web editor, that also organizes projects nicely.</p>
